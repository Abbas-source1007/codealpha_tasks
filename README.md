# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their physical measurements.

## 📊 Results
- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Test Accuracy**: 96.67%
- **Dataset**: 150 samples with 4 features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Run the Project
```python
# Load and run the Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook CodeAlpha_Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb
```

## 🔧 Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression (96.67% accuracy)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (93.33% accuracy) 
- Decision Tree Classifier (93.33% accuracy)

## 📈 Key Insights
1. Petal measurements are more discriminative than sepal measurements
2. Iris-setosa is easily separable from other species
3. All models achieved >90% accuracy
